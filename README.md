# Video-based Sign Language Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect sign language gestures from video data using deep learning techniques. Specifically, it utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, known as Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCNs), to extract spatio-temporal features from video frames and classify sign language gestures.

## Introduction

Sign language detection using videos has significant applications in assisting people with hearing impairments. This project utilizes deep learning techniques to automatically recognize sign language gestures from video sequences.

## Data Analysis

The initial step involves analyzing the dataset by visualizing sample frames from different sign language categories. This helps in understanding the nature of the data and the variety of gestures present.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning, correcting, and transforming the raw video data. This includes tasks such as resizing frames, normalizing pixel values, and extracting features from video sequences.

## Dataset Creation

The dataset is created by extracting frames from video files and organizing them into features, labels, and file paths. This step prepares the data for training and evaluation.

## Division of Data

The dataset is split into training and validation sets to train and evaluate the deep learning models. The split ensures that both sets maintain a similar distribution of sign language categories.

## Model Implementation

The core of the project involves implementing the LRCN model, which combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal modeling. The model architecture is designed to effectively capture spatio-temporal patterns in sign language gestures.

### LRCN Model

The LRCN model consists of convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, followed by LSTM layers for temporal modeling. The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and optimized using the Adam optimizer.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance in sign language gesture recognition. Metrics such as accuracy are used to measure the model's effectiveness.

## Future Work

Future work may involve fine-tuning the model architecture, exploring different deep learning techniques, and expanding the dataset to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
